Hello world,
This is a repository consisting of files I wrote to practice
things I learned in school.

Here is the description for each file:

1. pipe_experiment.cc
	A program that uses a pair of pipes (an up pipe and a down pipe). I just
	want to know how pipe works.
2. getopt_experiment.cc
	A program that uses getopt() to resolve arguments. I want to know how 
	getopt() works.
3. bubbleSort.cc
	A simple bubble sort program. I wrote this because I need to implement a
	multi-process bubble sort.
